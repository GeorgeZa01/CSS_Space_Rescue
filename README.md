CSS Space Rescue: Master Flexbox

CSS Space Rescue is an interactive, gamified learning experience designed to teach the fundamentals of CSS Flexbox. Players act as a space navigator, using CSS properties to position rescue ships and save stranded astronauts across 18 increasingly challenging levels.

18 Educational Levels: Covers everything from basic alignment (justify-content) to complex wrapping and axis manipulation (flex-direction, align-content).

Pro-Tip System: Each level includes a "Mission Briefing" and a specific technical "Pro-Tip" explaining the logic behind the CSS properties used.

Visual Feedback: Uses smooth transitions, particle effects (twinkling stars), and custom SVG-style emojis for an immersive sci-fi atmosphere.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the game works across different screen sizes.
